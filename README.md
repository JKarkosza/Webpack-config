Webpack-config using Yarn


Do all steps in main folder of your project!

If you don't have Yarn installed go to https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install or type this on terminal:

curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

and then:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn

After you get Yarn just type:
yarn add --dev webpack

To confing webpack create file and name it webpack.config.js

Basic configuration can look like this:

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.js',              --> entry file, webpack will start from that file
  output: {                           --> output file
    path: path.resolve('./dist'),     --> desire place to output file
    filename: 'main.js'               --> name of the output file
  }
};

To check if everything works you should have a file name "app.js" in "src" file and type "node_modules/.bin/webpack"

### Few entry files ###

You can use more than one entry file in your project. To do so you have to make entry point for everyone in webpack:

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/main.js',
    about: './src/about.js',
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve('./dist'),
    filename: '[name].js'
  }
};

You also have to change the output file and put placeholder, webpack automatically create files with right names.

Congratulations! You just set up your webpack :)
